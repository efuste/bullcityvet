            <h2>Dr. Leilani Sabin</h2>
            <p>Dr. Sabin is a 1993 graduate of North Carolina State College of Veterinary Medicine. She completed a small animal internship at Michigan State University in 1994 prior to returning to North Carolina to pursue a career in a small animal practice. In 2003, she purchased a veterinary hospital in Oxford, NC where she worked until selling the practice in 2009. It was at this point, Dr. Sabin took time off to take small animal acupuncture classes at the Chi Institute in Reddick, Florida. She has always had an interest in alternative and complementary medicine and was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to pursue this career avenue. She began Eastern-Western Mobile Veterinary Services of Durham to provide acupuncture for patients in their homes. She is now proud to be opening Bull City Veterinary Hospital in Downtown Durham. She plans to offer her patients general medicine, acupuncture, Chinese herbs, Tui na and Class IV therapeutic laser as it applies to each case.</p>
            <br /><p>Dr. Sabin has a 9 year old daughter, Mia. Dr. Sabin enjoys family time, running, dancing, beekeeping and practicing medical Qigong. She shares her home in the Northgate Park area with Mia, 2 dogs, 3 cats, and a silkie chicken named Irene.</p>

              <h3>Testimonial:</h3>
              <p> Dr. Sabin is awesome!  She has greatly enhanced the quality of life for CoCo, our 16 year-old Chow/German Shepherd mix, who has really bad arthritis in her hips and back legs.  Dr. Sabin has provided mobile veterinary care for CoCo in our home for over 2 years.  She alternates acupuncture treatments and laser therapy for CoCo on a weekly basis.  The treatments are so soothing and relaxing to CoCo that she actually falls asleep and appears disappointed when they are completed.  All of our experiences with Dr. Sabin demonstrate that she is a skillful, caring, accessible, and flexible vet; and just a wonderful and compassionate human being!  We feel very fortunate to have such a great combination of qualities in one individual to provide care for our beloved CoCo. I would highly recommend Dr. Sabin to anyone who demands the best of care possible for the furry members of their family!!<br />
