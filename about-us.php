			offering a wide range of medical services for cats and dogs. Our staff members have been carefully 
			selected for their ability to work as a team and communicate effectively for the well-being of our 
			patients. We strongly believe in the importance of continuing education. That’s why; every member of 
			our team receives ongoing training and education to continually improve their skills. </p>

			the most advanced diagnostic and surgical equipment to best serve all of our patient’s needs.
			We are conveniently located in the heart of downtown Durham. We are proud to be one of the first 
			veterinary hospitals opening in the downtown area and excited to serve the local community.
			Our goal is to provide excellent veterinary care, client education, and incredible customer service to 
			improve the well-being of our patients.</p>
